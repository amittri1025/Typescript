Ts is created to address shortcomings of Javascript

[typescript features] (./images/tsfeat.png)


Compile time: code -> m/c code
two errors occus : semantic (meaning less code) and syntax (wrong structure)

runtime : exec of program (usually after compile time)




in statically typed language
we know, the type of variables at compile time
e.g. C++, C#, Java


in Dynamically, 
the type of variable is decided later at runtime (ofc when program is compiled even with errors ) e.g javascript, python, ruby
